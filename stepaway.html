    <h2>Giving up the CEO Role (January 2000)</h2>
    <p>At the height of the antitrust legal battles, Gates stepped down as CEO of Microsoft in January 2000.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Successor:</strong> He handed the reins to his college friend, Steve Ballmer, who had been with
        the company since 1980.</li>
      <li><strong>New Role:</strong> Gates didn't leave; he created a new title for himself: "Chief Software Architect."
        This allowed him to focus purely on product strategy and code without the burden of running the business side
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The End of Daily Work (June 2008)</h2>
    <p>Gates stepped down from his full-time day-to-day role at Microsoft.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Reason:</strong> He wanted to dedicate the majority of his time to the Bill & Melinda Gates
        Foundation.</li>
      <li><strong>The "Last Day":</strong> His final full-time day was June 27, 2008. Microsoft released a famous comedy
        video for his retirement featuring celebrities like George Clooney and Bono trying to find Gates a new hobby.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Status:</strong> He remained Chairman of the Board, meaning he still led the group that fired/hired
        the CEO.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Stepping Down as Chairman (February 2014)</h2>
    <p>When Steve Ballmer retired and Satya Nadella was named the new CEO, Gates stepped down as Chairman of the Board.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>New Role:</strong> He took the title "Technology Advisor," promising to help Nadella with product
        development. This was largely symbolic, signaling that the "Gates/Ballmer Era" was officially over and it was
        now Nadella's company.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Final Departure (March 2020)</h2>
    <p>Gates resigned from the Microsoft Board of Directors entirely.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Offical Reason</strong> He stated he wanted to dedicate his time fully to philanthropy (global health,
        education, and climate change).</li>
      <li><strong>Behind The Scenes</strong> In 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported that before his resignation, the
        board had hired a law firm to investigate a romantic relationship Gates had with an employee years prior. Gates
        resigned before the investigation was concluded, though his spokesperson said the decision to leave was
        unrelated to the inquiry.</li>
    </ul>
